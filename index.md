## Sessions

We are jointly organising two Parallel Sessions to discuss how machine learning supports our science and how we might overcome the challenges it now faces.

- Machine Learning in Modern Astronomy (Techniques2)
- The Future of Machine Learning in Astronomy (Techniques3)

Techniques2 focuses on recent innovative and successful applications of ML in astronomy [(full proposal here)](https://nam2022.org/science/parallel-sessions/details/2/170). This session will showcase the crucial role machine learning plays in enabling science.

Techniques3 focuses on the challenges such methods face and their speculative solutions [(full proposal here)](https://nam2022.org/science/parallel-sessions/details/2/171). This session will consider how we can shape the future of machine learning to create the tools we need. 

## Abstract Submission


**Abstracts submitted to one session will be jointly considered for both sessions.**

We anticipate that many talks will potentially be relevant to either session, and so we will review all abstracts jointly.
Accepted abstracts will be placed in the session whose focus best matches the submitted abstract (see above).
This applies to both talks and posters.

We would like to highlight a few key points from the [NAM 2022 Abstract Submission page](https://nam2022.org/science/abstract-submission):

- "Assessment will be performed blind, without knowledge of who has submitted each abstract".
- "All persons who submitted an abstract will be informed by the SOC whether it has been accepted or not by 13th May".
- "If your abstract is accepted you must register for the conference and pay registration fees by 3rd June 2022, or your abstract acceptance will be withdrawn".

**Abstracts are due at 23:59 BST (UTC+1) this Thursday (April 14th).**

## Timetable

The draft NAM 2022 schedule suggests the following session times:

- Techniques2 on Wednesday at 16:30-18:00
- Techniques3 on Thursday at 14:30-16:00


Note that this timetable is not published and is subject to change by the NAM organising committee at any time. We will update this page once the timetable is finalised.

We will published a detailed timetable once abstracts have been recieved, accepted, and confirmed.

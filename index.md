## Sessions

We are jointly organising two Parallel Sessions to discuss how machine learning supports our science and how we might overcome the challenges it now faces.

- Machine Learning in Modern Astronomy (Techniques2)
- The Future of Machine Learning in Astronomy (Techniques3)

Techniques2 focuses on recent innovative and successful applications of ML in astronomy [(full proposal here)](https://nam2022.org/science/parallel-sessions/details/2/170). This session will showcase the crucial role machine learning plays in enabling science.

Techniques3 focuses on the challenges such methods face and their speculative solutions [(full proposal here)](https://nam2022.org/science/parallel-sessions/details/2/171). This session will consider how we can shape the future of machine learning to create the tools we need. 

## Abstract Submission

Abstract submission is now **closed**. We recieved 44 abstracts across both sessions (2x 1.5 hours). We look forward to seeing your work at NAM 2022!

Given the sessions' popularity, we will only be considering late abstracts in exceptional circumstances (e.g. personal emergency). Please write to the organisers (see [Contact](#contact)) with a brief explanation if you would like to submit a late abstract. Do NOT include the abstract itself.

For reference, you can review the original abstract submission instructions [here](abstract_submission_reference.md).
## Timetable

The draft NAM 2022 schedule suggests the following session times:

- Techniques2 on Wednesday at 16:30-18:00
- Techniques3 on Thursday at 14:30-16:00


Note that this timetable is not published and is subject to change by the NAM organising committee at any time. We will update this page once the timetable is finalised.

We will published a detailed timetable once abstracts have been recieved, accepted, and confirmed.

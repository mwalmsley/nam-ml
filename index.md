## NAM 2022 - ML sessions
### Session Location: [Social Sciences](http://campus-cms.warwick.ac.uk/share/872acbbad9752bf58e4a5e3be2dd82ad) --- [Room S0.11](https://theta360.com/s/cCEqLppMmQ9eEYx8xXQbHndlQ) (Ground Floor; [annoated campus map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VKFuRkjLWJAlNgjQUU6VqrXfbyIzsuFk/view))

We are jointly organising two Parallel Sessions to discuss how machine learning supports our science and how we might overcome the challenges it now faces. The [timetable](#timetable) is available below.

- Machine Learning in Modern Astronomy (Techniques2)
- The Future of Machine Learning in Astronomy (Techniques3)

Techniques2 focuses on recent innovative and successful applications of ML in astronomy [(full proposal here)](https://nam2022.org/science/parallel-sessions/details/2/170). This session will showcase the crucial role machine learning plays in enabling science.

Techniques3 focuses on the challenges such methods face and their speculative solutions [(full proposal here)](https://nam2022.org/science/parallel-sessions/details/2/171). This session will consider how we can shape the future of machine learning to create the tools we need. 

## Abstract Submission

Abstract submission is now **closed**. We recieved 44 abstracts across both sessions (2x 1.5 hours). We look forward to seeing your work at NAM 2022!

Given the sessions' popularity, we will only be considering late abstracts in exceptional circumstances (e.g. personal emergency). Please write to the organisers (see [Contact](#contact)) with a brief explanation if you would like to submit a late abstract. Do NOT include the abstract itself.

For reference, you can review the original abstract submission instructions [here](abstract_submission_reference.md).

## Timetable

The draft NAM 2022 schedule suggests the following session times:

- Techniques2 on Wednesday at 16:30-18:00
- Techniques3 on Thursday at 14:30-16:00

### Wednesday (13 July) 16:30-18:00
#### Technique2: Machine Learning in Modern Astronomy: Learning and Interpreting the Data Driven Universe

- 16:30-16:35 \-\- Thomas Killestein \-\- **Introduction**
- 16:35-16:55 \-\- Emily Hunt \-\- 

  **The power (and caveats) of clustering algorithms applied to Gaia data**
  > *The speaker will present the results of a comparative study they conducted detecting star clusters in Gaia DR2 using a range of different clustering algorithms. In this talk, they will (1) discuss the challenges in applying clustering algorithms, (2) provide a star cluster catalogue based on a clustering analysis of 729 million stars in Gaia EDR3 using the HDBSCAN algorithm, and (3) comment on how to (possibly) reslove some remaining issues in clusteing algorithms. Jupyter notebooks and codes will be available on GitHub.*

- 16:55-17:10 \-\- Timothy A Davis \-\- 

  **Self-supervised, physics-aware, Bayesian neural networks for modelling galaxy emission-line kinematics**
  > *The speaker will present a new self-supervised, physics-aware, Bayesian neural network architecture, which has excellent performance at modeling 2D kinematic moments and extracting physical parameters directly. Models of this type are fully explainable and include uncertainty quantification. They will showcase their excellent performance by presenting the largest ever study of the Tully-Fisher relation, for ~5000 MaNGA and SAMI galaxies, and discuss further development of this algorithm to full 3D modeling of datacubes.*

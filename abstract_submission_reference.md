This is a copy of the original abstract submission instructions. Note that abstract submission has **closed**.

---

**Abstracts submitted to one session will be jointly considered for both sessions.**

We anticipate that many talks will potentially be relevant to either session, and so we will review all abstracts jointly.
Accepted abstracts will be placed in the session whose focus best matches the submitted abstract (see above).
This applies to both talks and posters.

We would like to highlight a few key points from the [NAM 2022 Abstract Submission page](https://nam2022.org/science/abstract-submission):

- "Assessment will be performed blind, without knowledge of who has submitted each abstract".
- "All persons who submitted an abstract will be informed by the SOC whether it has been accepted or not by 13th May".
- "If your abstract is accepted you must register for the conference and pay registration fees by 3rd June 2022, or your abstract acceptance will be withdrawn".

**Abstracts are due at 23:59 BST (UTC+1) this Thursday (April 14th).**
